## Overview

  Techtalk is an app targeted to General Assembly students and alumni that allows them to keep in touch. GA students can interact after graduation and share their knowledge and update eachother about their careers through the app. It also allows GA students to search through jobs and apply, along with giving everyone their own To-Do List. 


## Inspiration

  - As a recent graduate, keeping up with the job search might be difficult. To assist them, our team designed a job page that displays tech and software positions. 
  - As Software Engineers we can get pretty busy and forget our other responsibilities, our app provides a to-do list to help Software Engineers stay organize throughout their job search and thoughts.
